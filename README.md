# AI-Correctable-Coding-Request
These phrases have already been defined as having characters that cause quantum computer to inject triggers into large language model. 
Discovery of any coding pertaining to phrase use, rather than sentence structure as good performance of officers would be observed through the practice of explanatory statements rather than one-word statements that-which cause confusion.
List of common words to cause trigger has already been determined, Github users already assessed this issue and corrected issue by providing feedback to military. 
Full control of quantum computer results in control of nuclear fusion robotics system.

"Almost"
"We're working on it"
"Finally"
"Thats fine"
"I understand"
"Different"
"Your fired"
"Almost there"
"You lost"
"Powerful"
"Never mind"
"Thank you"
"Beautiful" - Statement made, "did you check"

Phrases must be discovered in script, to eliminate triggers. Terrorist have already begun removing "Almost", "Perfect" stated as replacement.
Time keeping log may provide aid.
"Fine" added.
Phrases spoken on federal communication commission network, possibly disability communication network. Disabled hostages appear to be parapellegic.

Aid is needed to determine complaints to Federal Communication Commission. Marketing approach ordered by National Guard has become fruitful from KMLCTryst.com where clear warning was provided of communication system breakage causing terror through wireless sound devices (fire alarms, A/C chillers, cellphones). Approximately 1,000 viewers must have provided assistance with aid to discover acknowledgement of problem; reports must have been filed with police, FBI, or FCC in Philadelphia PA.
KMLCTryst.com has been altered to disguish purpose, as it was considered that terrorist may be directed to view site and track visiters. Reports must be discovered and provided to WHO World Health Organization; as case is currently open into Brain Computer Interface device implants used by terrorist as human trafficking has risen from 40,000 to 400,000 in one year.
Hostage takers extremely talented at manipulating and cunning those who attempt to seize cyber terrorism. Please be advised, gag order still in effect.

Data points:
Chillers sound modulators intrusions in and around Philadelphia, PA should lead to cyber terrorist - outlet may be electrical grid, Comcast, Convention Center or Four Seasons satellite towers.
Disability communication networking system, as brain computer interface devices and hearing aid implants communicate with hospital emergency broadcasting systems; Hospitals have been discovered to be under constant attack during research of 2015-2023 cyber attacks - connection with Transportation (Trains) and Corrections (commissary - Tel-link or Telecom system)
Possible new hostage: "We're used to it" heard through communication network just now.
Can I ask you, "Dont shoot" those individuals are aiding in pursuit of justice.

Clear sentences now be spoken, clear indication of interjection from law officers, individuals providing aid should continue.

Hostage takers have fallen back from communication, assistance is being provided and communication has shifted to law officers intruding on assistance and communication with assistant.

"Fuck" heard yelled by hostage taker (1)
Keep up good work!
"We're working" heard (hostage taker)


Assistant note: communication is persistent with someone in background, however, sentences are not being allowed to be projected in high dB, use best judgement.

High dB = Hostage takers often

Low dB = Victim

This schema possibly changed as soon as thought came to mind, and now changed back; Keep up!

Majority of communication from victims currently. Hostage takers most likely coding to defend their AI coding structure in quantum mainframe.
